# div-game
simple click for points game to relearn some html/css/js






## TO DO:
- separate things out into their own functions where appropriate so as to better add more features/functionality
- add counter for points and bombs remaining (so maybe there can be a smidgen of strategy...)
- add bomb defusers (lives)
- add different point types (subtractors, multpliers)
- add xray item (see one cell before actually clicking it)
