# div-game
simple click for points game to relearn some html/css/js






## TO DO:
- separate things out into their own functions where appropriate so as to better add more features/functionality
- add endgame display
- add some functionality buttons (at least a play again button?)
- add a legend for different items?
- add different point types (subtractors, multpliers)
- add xray item (see one cell before actually clicking it)
