# div-game
simple click for points game to relearn some html/css/js



- basics: have a grid of divs, user clicks on them to see what is beneath

- simple ones to start: points added, bomb(s) (click and game is over)

- more possibilities: points subtracted, point multiplier, 

- maybe add items: bomb defuser (lets you live through one bomb), xray (lets you see one cell before clicking it)

- display: total score, maybe number of point cells and/or bomb cells??

- keep very simple for now, maybe improve later with nice display, multiple levels, high score saving, etc.
